title: Use the MCP SDK
---

Use the Mastercard Developers MCP SDK if you want to embed the MCP server in your own application or customize the behavior.

The SDK is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mastercard/developers-agent-toolkit)

1.  Install the SDK in your project. You can then use the included `MastercardDevelopersAgentToolkit` class to serve your content over stdio.
    
    ```bash
    npm install --save @mastercard/developers-agent-toolkit
    ```
    
2.  To launch an MCP server that communicates via standard input/output (stdio), create a file called server.mjs and paste in the following code:
    
    ```JS
    
    import { MastercardDevelopersAgentToolkit } from "@mastercard/developers-agent-toolkit/mcp";
    import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
    
    const server = new MastercardDevelopersAgentToolkit({});
    
    async function main() {
      const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
      await server.connect(transport);
      console.error("Mastercard Developers MCP Server running on stdio");
    }
    
    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error("Fatal error in main():", error);
      process.exit(1);
    });
    ```
    
3.  Run the server.
    
    ```bash
    node server.mjs
    ```
    
4.  You’ll see a message like - `Mastercard Developers MCP Server running on stdio`
    
    At this point, your server is live and ready to be connected to any MCP-compatible client.
    

# Integration with MCP Clients

You can connect this SDK-hosted server to any MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or VS Code). Integration steps may vary depending on the client, but most tools support launching the server via a config file, for example, tools like Cursor use a file called `mcp.config.json`.

## Configuration Options

You can launch the MCP server with specific context to limit the scope to one Mastercard service or API. This helps AI agents focus only on what’s relevant.

| Option | What it does | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `service` | Tells the MCP server to focus on a single service’s documentation | `https://developer.mastercard.com/mdes-customer-service/documentation` |
| `apiSpecification` | Provides a raw OpenAPI/Swagger spec URL, overriding the service config if both are used | `https://static.developer.mastercard.com/content/match/swagger/match-pro.yaml` |

> [!ALERT]
> 
> If you specify service or api-specification then the get-services-list tool will be disabled.
